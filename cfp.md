The MOOMIN workshop invites contributions related but not limited to the following topics:
 - mixture of expert models and gated routing
 - modular pre-training of multilingual language and translation models
 - effective transfer with modular architectures such as adapters and hypernetworks
 - efficient parallelization and distribution of modular model training
 - modular frameworks and architecture implementations
 - massively multilingual models with large language coverage
 - subnet selection and pruning
 - modular distillation
 - modular extensions of existing NLP models systems, especially in low-resource settings and for low-resource languages
 - evaluation of modular systems in terms of performance, efficiency, and computational costs
 - platforms for distributing, sharing, and integrating NLP components
