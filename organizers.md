### Workshop Organizers

##### [Timothee Mickus](timotheemickus.github.io), University of Helsinki
Timothee Mickus is a  post-doctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, within the ERC project [_Found in Translation_ (FoTran)](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/fotran/), where he develops and maintains the [MAMMOTH modular MT framework](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/mammoth).
His research focuses on representation learning, model interpretability and natural language generation. 
He previously organized the CoDWoE shared task at SemEval 2022 and is a current co-organizer for the [SHROOM shared task at SemEval 2024](https://helsinki-nlp.github.io/shroom/).

##### [Jörg Tiedemann](blogs.helsinki.fi/tiedeman), University of Helsinki
Jörg Tiedemann is a professor of language technology at the University of Helsinki. 
His research interests are in multilingual and cross-lingual NLP including machine translation and representation learning. 
He is the PI of the ERC project [_Found in Translation_ (FoTran)](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/fotran/) and the [GreenNLP](https://greennlp.github.io/) project, which are both supporting the workshop. 

##### [Ahmet Üstün](ahmetustun.github.io), Cohere For AI 
Ahmet Üstün is a research scientist at [Cohere For AI](https://cohere.for.ai/). 
He has previously earned a PhD from the University of Groningen. 
His research interests are multi-task, multilingual, and efficient natural language processing with a particular focus on modular approaches and low-resource languages. 
He is a leading member of [AYA Open Science Initiative](https://txt.cohere.com/aya-multilingual/).

##### [Raúl Vázquez](https://jrvc.github.io/), University of Helsinki 
Raúl is a soon-to-defend PhD student at the University of Helsinki. His research is centered around the ERC project [FoTran](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/fotran/), where he develops models for natural language understanding using multilingual data and neural machine translation systems; also 
analyzing the internal dynamics of those systems. He is a current co-organizer for the [SemEval 2024 shared task SHROOM](https://helsinki-nlp.github.io/shroom/).

##### [Ivan Vulic](sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/), University of Cambridge and PolyAI 
Ivan is a Principal Research Associate and a Royal Society University Research Fellow in the [Language Technology Lab](https://www.languagesciences.cam.ac.uk/departments/language-technology-lab-university-of-cambridge) at the University of Cambridge, and a Senior Scientist at [PolyAI](https://poly.ai/).
His research interests are in multilingual, multimodal and modular representation learning, and transfer learning for low-resource languages and applications such as task-oriented dialogue systems.
